# Social Network API (NoSQL)

## Description

This project application uses Express.js and MongoDB. This application demonstrates how to use MongoDB in replace of MySQL. With MongoDB you do not need to write sql queries in order to find the data you need. The data is shown through insomnia and also does not need any seeding, thus you will need to edit the data for your own purposes.
